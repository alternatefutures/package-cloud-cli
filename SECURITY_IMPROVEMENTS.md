## 🛡️ Security Infrastructure Implemented

### 1. Automated Security Scanning

#### Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- Weekly automated dependency updates
- Separate tracking for npm and GitHub Actions dependencies
- Automatic security patch grouping
- Pull request limits to prevent overwhelming maintainers

#### CodeQL Analysis (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)
- Automated code security scanning
- Security-extended queries
- Weekly scheduled scans plus PR/push triggers
- JavaScript/TypeScript analysis

#### Security Audit Workflow (`.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`)
- Daily automated vulnerability scans via `pnpm audit`
- TruffleHog integration for secret scanning
- Artifact retention for audit history
- Runs on all PRs and pushes

#### Dependency Review (`.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`)
- Blocks PRs with moderate+ severity vulnerabilities
- Prevents GPL-3.0 and AGPL-3.0 licenses
- Automated PR comments with security findings

### 2. Enhanced Linting Rules (`biome.json`)

Added comprehensive security-focused linting rules:
- **Security rules**: No dangerous HTML, no eval
- **Suspicious code detection**: 20+ rules for catching potential bugs
- **Complexity management**: Code quality enforcement
- **Best practices**: Optional chaining, no useless constructors

### 3. Development Standards

#### CODEOWNERS (`.github/CODEOWNERS`)
- Security team reviews for sensitive files
- Separate ownership for auth, CI/CD, and dependencies
- Automatic review requests

#### Enhanced PR Template
- Comprehensive security checklist (9 items)
- Type of change classification
- Testing requirements
- Documentation requirements

---

## 🔧 Configuration Improvements

### Node Version Management (`.nvmrc`)
- Pinned Node.js version to 20.18.1
- Ensures consistent development environment
- Prevents version-related security issues

### Dependency Overrides (`package.json`)
```json
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "ws": ">=8.17.1",
    "esbuild": ">=0.24.2"
  }
}
```
- Forces secure versions of transitive dependencies
- Prevents vulnerable versions from being installed
- Maintains compatibility while ensuring security
